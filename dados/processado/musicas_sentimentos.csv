[Verse 3: Lauryn Hill]
Loving you is a like a song I replay
Every three minutes and thirty seconds of every day
And every chorus was written for us to recite
Every beautiful melody of devotion every night
This potion might, this ocean might carry me
In a wave of emotion to ask you to marry me
And every word, every second, and every third
Expresses a happiness more clearly than ever heard
And when I play 'em, every chord is a poem
Telling the Lord how grateful I am cause I know him
The harmonies possess, a sensation similar to your caress
If you asking then I'm telling you it's yes
Stand in love, take my hand and love Jah bless
Right, right

[Chorus: Bob Marley, Lauryn Hill, & Both]
I want to give you some good, good loving
Turn your lights down low (Right, right now)
And-a pull your window curtains (I said right, right now)
And let Jah love come tumbling in (Right, right now)
Into our lives again (Uh, uh, I said right, right now)
Sayin', ooh, it's been a long, long time
Yeah, I got this message for you, boy
But it seems I was never on time
Still I wanna get through to you, boy (Uh, yeah)
On time (Right, right now)
On time (Uh, I said right, right now)
I want to give you some love
I want to give you some good, good lovin' (Can ya hear me?)

And say I'm going bad

Be sure your hands are clean

Though I just dropped by to let you know
That I'm leaving you tomorrow;

Dreamland (feat. Bunny Wailer),"2 ContributorsDreamland (feat. Bunny Wailer) LyricsThere's a land that I have heard about
So far across the sea

To have you all, my dreamland
Would be like heaven to me
To have you all, my dreamland

We'll get our honey from the bees
We'll take a ride on the waterfalls
And all the glories, we'll have them all

And we'll live together on that dreamland
And have so much fun
We'll live together on that dreamland
And have so much fun

Oh, what a time that will be
Oh, just you, wait, wait, wait and see
We'll count the stars up in the sky
And surely we'll never die

Shall live on and on.

Got to get the action.
Got love and affection.

Once there was two roads before us
To pick our choice.
But good has overcome bad.
The sheep has heard their master's voice.
So tell me why.
Why should I bend down my head and cry?
No reason why.

You are you,"1 ContributorYou are you LyricsWhile silent sky keeps birds
You 're going through my eyes
While the water floats Now
I dream about your hair
I think I walk
But I'm not sure
I do not know whether I'm singing
Or when I cry wolf
Whether I'm alive
I do not know
Because you are my golden age
You're my air
You are you
You are you
You are my big time
You know that i love youYou might also likeEmbed",,,0.10833333333333334
